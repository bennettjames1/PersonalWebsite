										<h2 class="major">Who am I?</h2>
										<p>I am a graduate student in computer engineering at NC State. I will be graduating in May 2021.  I am looking for opportuntities to further enhancement or utilize my skillset.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Where I'm from</h2>
										<p>I am originally from Monroe, NC which is just outside of Charlotte. I have always had a knack for new technologies and always stayed on the cutting edge. After going to a magnet high school and taking several engineering classes it gave me a background on several different engineerings particularly mechanical, electrical, computer, and civil engineering. At NC State I have taken my passions for technologies and applied them to my major in Computer Engineering learning many valuable skills in topics that I am passionate about.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Outside of the classroom</h2>
										<p>I am a passionate student giving academics one of the greatest priorities in my life, but who I am outside the classroom is just as important as who I am in the classroom. With my free time I enjoy playing sports, competing in intramural sports and club flag football.  I also enjoy lifting weights, traveling, going on adventures, and completing side projects such as this website.</p>

											<h3 class="major">LSTM</h3>
											<p>Designed g(t) gate for an LSTM using verilog for design and synopsys for verification. Calculations performed in my design were matrix multiplication of a 16x16 matrix by a 16x1, tanh lookup of resultant values, and interpolation on these values for higher accuracy.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Touchscreen Display</h3>
											<p>Interfaced with a FRDM KL25Z board to modify base code to share the ADC between an LED and touchscreen using osMessageQueue and then drawing measured current vs set current on touchscreen at posedge of flash.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Optimizing Accelerometer</h3>
											<p>Interfaced with an accelerometer to optimize its use by a RTCS that before was using blocking code but created a FSM to return control to the scheduler as well as remove all busy loops. Detailed project report showing flowcharts for the design of the FSM as well as I2C communications and timing screenshots showing the benefits of my design can be found at link below.</p>

											<h3 class="major">GPS Optical Transceiver</h3>
											<p>As a group for senior design we were tasked with designing a optical transceiver to reliably communicate GPS signal for drone recovery system used by NAVAIR. The current system is wired and the cable is often broken causing the module on the ground to short and for GPS communications to be lost. My roles included providing the FSK modulation technique to the Tx circuit and designing the mechanical enclosure.</p>

											<h3 class="major">IoT Miniature Car</h3>
											<p>Designed, built, soldered, and programmed a small car that could be controlled through an IoT module to send directional commands and also be commanded to follow a black line. Programming was done using an IAR Embedded Workbench and the microcontroller used was in the MSP430 family. The coding for the project was completed individaully but the report linked below was completed in groups of 4.</p>

											<h3 class="major">MIPS Pipeline</h3>
											<p>Designed and implemented in C++ a pipeline to handle both integer and floating point instructions for a 5 stage pipeline. This pipeline can handle control hazards, data dependency hazards, and structural hazards. For testing purposes, this design was able to accurately compute the correct number of stalls, cycles, instructions executed, and IPC.</p>
